## SSR (NextJS) vs. CSR (CreateReactApp)

Some resources I've read about the advantages and disadvantages of each:

==> https://blog.logrocket.com/next-js-vs-create-react-app/
==> https://medium.appbase.io/part1-getting-started-with-react-and-nextjs-4f28a6a0c38e

What I've gathered so far: SSR is usually the best option, especially for 
gaining SEO notoriety and implementing analytics. It also depends on the purpose 
the app serves, and the experience we want out of it:
- an e-comerce app would benefit from ssr;
- a highly-interactive web app would benefit from csr;
